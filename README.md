9/18 ADDED WHITE BORDER SO i CAN SEE THE MARGINS AND PADDINGS TEMPORARILY
9/30 Planning to add Themes and done with optimizing some codes

10/1 done na sa base ng theme color.. pag aaralan pa yung flow ng js para mmapalitan yung  <link rel="stylesheet" id="themesheet" href="CSS/Themes/default.css" /> galing sa mga nasa theme folder na CSS via js.
-- daming pagkakataong nag rollback yung codes dahil sa brownout and internet interruption.

10/3 successfully implemented theme color change (after 3 hours of debug and re-testing) using root:has on navi.css -- aayusin nlang yung ibang kulay and mag dadagdag nlang ng ibang kulay para di masakit sa mata.. pero overall napagana yung self task ko..
Future task-- adding default color scheme and saving last selected color scheme using local storage key and value.

10/9 getting in depth with Git and Github commands -- I was used to stackblitz with so much automatic straight commit and push funtionality -- I need to standarize my process that's why I'm getting the basics of GitHub and Git -- so far I encounters so minimal errors on the precess, which is good 

11/11 i've been trying sass for these past few days after ther brgy. election, my script for themes and animation on navilst is not working now. up until this point I can't diagnose what was the problem. maybe when im saving my scss? or maybe because continious yung pag modify ni sass sa css? IM STRESSED OUT ilang araw na  to pero di ko padin ma fix. If you're reading this help me

12/12 After sometime and some push of my friends, I finally get back to my battle station. Also fixed theme selector. after doing some research for 1 and a half day. Kaya naman palang pag haluin ang SCSS at JS. planning to add a page for my codepen.io creations.

12/13 INTRODUCING CAlculaTHOR.  Made in one sitting. also Fixed Theme selector. It can now reemember last picked theme, even if you reload the page. thanks to LocalStorage.

12/17 - Added contact in footer some functionality
- Can now copy link to clipboard
- added LinkedIn profile
- Can now go to link in the new tab

 button's design to be updated tommorow

01/28 

Added Ceasar Cipher app
-- added nerd stats so you can check how many times you clicked the encrypt and decrypt button. xample usage, if you decrpyt "lnjbja lryqna" with key 3, 4 times. you'll get ceasar cipher. the times to click the button can act like an addtional security measure.
